## üìù Overview

This repository showcases different machine learning models and techniques, ranging from classic machine learning to more advanced machine learning implementations. Each project includes a detailed explanation, code implementation, and setup.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. **[Project 1: Chatbot with NLP](link-to-chatbot-folder)**
   - **Description**: A chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The project uses TF-IDF for text vectorization and Logistic Regression for intent classification.
   - **Techniques**: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, intent classification, Streamlit UI.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports multiple intents (greetings, help, farewell, etc.).
     - Trained once and loads the model for use without retraining.
     - Interactive web-based interface with Streamlit.
   
### 2. **[Project 2: Text Classification with NLP](link-to-project-folder)**
   - **Description**: Implementation of a text classification model using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression for sentiment analysis.
   - **Techniques**: Text preprocessing, tokenization, vectorization, classification.
   
### 3. **[Project 3: Image Classification with CNN](link-to-project-folder)**
   - **Description**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - **Techniques**: Deep learning, data augmentation, model evaluation.
   
### 4. **[Project 4: Customer Segmentation with K-Means](link-to-project-folder)**
   - **Description**: Unsupervised learning approach to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
   - **Techniques**: K-Means clustering, PCA for dimensionality reduction.

### 5. **[Project 5: House Price Prediction](link-to-project-folder)**
   - **Description**: Linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features.
   - **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, regression analysis, evaluation metrics.

## üõ† Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. Install required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Navigate to the project folder and run the script as described in each project‚Äôs README.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Each project contains a separate folder with its own README that provides detailed instructions on how to run the code, including dataset links and implementation steps. For example, to run the Chatbot project:

cd chatbot_project
python app.py
